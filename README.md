# Searchlist.org
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fort-kickass/searchlist_s3_frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fort-kickass/searchlist_s3_frontend)

This is the frontend html code for what is/will become `searchlist.org`, a website build by Dan Cash and Cliff Shull for the purpose of learning and building a completely serverless website.  Also it will search/return links to Craigslist searches from all CL sites within a specified distance of a starting city. (note: the build status is more there to let us know our deployments our succeeded, not that our wealth of testing is passing)

## searchlist_s3_frontend
This specific project on github is the frontend HTML/CSS/JS code that lives in a AWS S3 bucket and runs as a static website.  It reaches out via API Gateway to trigger Lambda code that calculates a list of CL sites within the specified distance and uses [Pusher](https:/pusher.com) to push the resulting cities back to the static webpage.  Eventually it will also trigger Lambda code to run a CL search for each returned city.

## searchlist_lambda_distance
This is the lambda code that is triggered by the frontend to search through a caluclated matrix of CL sites and return a list of those within x distance of y CL city.  The matrix was generated by Dan Cash in 2016 via google api's and may be(probably is) innacurate.  The code used to generate this matrix will uploaded at a later time....hopfully!
